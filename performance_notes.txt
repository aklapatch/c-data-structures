Adding quadratic probes to values searching really sped things up.
I may add a version of cuckoo hashing next (hash the hash to find the 
next slot). (done, not much better than quadratic probing IIRC)
Searching for values still takes a lot of time. (Fixed)
Changing to a version of cuckoo hash makes lookups take longer.
Tried splitting the table into 2 partitions, so that you are looking in
a different section of memory when you find a collision, but that slowed
things down
The hash and hash again probing is much faster than quadratic probing
for insertions From what I can tell. For queries it seems to be a little
better
